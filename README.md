# Clustering-courses-by-popularity
In this project we are looking at the amount of enrolled grad students in Cornell every year and determine which field should be considered in a scale from 1 to 5 that goes from Very Popular to Very Unpopular. By using clusters we can see that how many fields belong to each category in a strategic way instead of simply using the TOP 20% as very popular and so on. This can help the university understand how popular their most popular fields actually are and could potentially be used as a KPI. An example can be, that the school wants their courses to have more enrollments, therefore if they use clustering they can see if the ranges that each cluster increase than their effort was useful, if not students simply overlapped from one to another. 


# Analysis
I created five categories which are Very popular, popular, average, unpopular and Very unpopular. What we can see is that the average enrolled students for each category are as shown in the nest table.
